                            # âœ” To sum Up
                            my-api (act as resource server)
                            Auth0 (act as authorization server)
                            funApp (frontend + backend) act as Client who is trying to access my-api on behalf of a user.

- [x] App frontend -> login and authorize->Auth0
- [x] Auth0-> sends authorization code to App
- [x] App frontend request data with authorization code-> App backend
- [x] App Backend requests exchange of authorization code to get access token -> Auth0
- [x] Auth0 sends acces token -> App backend
- [x] App backend-> uses access token to access resources(make api calls to resource server)
- [x] before response the resource server checks with the Auth0 server for the validity of the access token and finally sends data back to App backend.
- [x] App backend then returns data back to App frontend .
